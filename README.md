An End-to-End Machine Learning Model is a comprehensive system that contains all the stages of a machine learning project, from data collection and preprocessing to model development, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. If you want to learn how to build an end-to-end Machine Learning model, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll take you through how to build an end-to-end Machine Learning model using Python and Dash (a UI framework).


Building an End-to-End Machine Learning Model: Process We Can Follow
To build an end-to-end Machine Learning model, you first need to train a Machine Learning model as you do in every Machine Learning problem you solve. Once you have trained your model, below is the process you can follow to turn your Machine Learning model into an end-to-end solution using the dash framework:

Set up a new Dash application.
Create the layout of the app using Dash’s HTML and Core Components. It includes input fields, buttons, and output display areas.
Write callback functions to define the interactivity of the app, such as taking user inputs, running the model prediction, and displaying the results.
Load the model within the app to use for predictions.
So, the process starts with building a Machine Learning model
